# TSK - quick time estimate

Quickly estimate time using markdown:

~~~
> cat plan.md
# Project

## One

Time: 100 h

## Two

Time: 23 h

> tsk plad.md
Time: 3w 3h
~~~

## Details

This tool is to give the author a sense of how
long the outlined project will take. The goal
is not to:

- plan week by week
- allocate resources
- determine task dependence

just to estimate. Which is fine for a small
project.

Time markers:

- h -> hours
- d -> days (8 hours)
- w -> weeks (5 days)
- y -> years (52 weeks)
